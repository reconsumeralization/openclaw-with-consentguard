# Vulnerability Management

OpenClaw provides tools for tracking vulnerabilities, checking systems, and monitoring patch cycles.

## Overview

The vulnerability management system allows you to:
- Track CVEs and vulnerabilities
- Check if systems/package versions are vulnerable
- Monitor patch deployment status
- Detect exploit attempts

## Tools

### `vuln_track`

Track a CVE or vulnerability with metadata including CVSS score and affected products.

**Example:**
```
vuln_track({
  cveId: "CVE-2024-1234",
  description: "Remote code execution vulnerability",
  cvssScore: 9.8,
  affectedProducts: ["package@1.0.0"]
})
```

### `vuln_check`

Check if a system/package version is vulnerable. Queries CVE database and returns vulnerability status.

**Example:**
```
vuln_check({
  packageName: "package",
  version: "1.0.0"
})
```

### `vuln_patch_status`

Track patch deployment status. Monitors patch cycles with target of <24 hours for critical vulnerabilities.

**Example:**
```
vuln_patch_status({
  cveId: "CVE-2024-1234",
  systemId: "server-01"
})
```

### `vuln_exploit_detection`

Detect exploit attempts against tracked vulnerabilities by matching network/process activity to known exploit patterns.

**Example:**
```
vuln_exploit_detection({
  cveId: "CVE-2024-1234",
  sourceIp: "192.0.2.1"
})
```

## Configuration

Enable vulnerability management in your config:

```json5
{
  cybersecurity: {
    vulnerabilityManagement: {
      enabled: true,
      nvdApiKey: "your-nvd-api-key",
      patchWindowHours: 24,
      autoCheck: false
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** NVD API integration is pending. Current implementations provide stub functionality.
