## Codebase grounding for all drafts

- Tool invocation over HTTP runs through `POST /tools/invoke` in `src/gateway/tools-invoke-http.ts`, with auth, policy resolution, default HTTP deny list, and then `tool.execute(...)`.
- Node execution runs through `node.invoke` server handlers in `src/gateway/server-methods/nodes.ts` and executes on node hosts in `src/node-host/invoke.ts`.
- Existing hardening already present:
  - Gateway HTTP default deny list (`sessions_spawn`, `sessions_send`, `gateway`, `whatsapp_login`) in `src/security/dangerous-tools.ts`.
  - Exec approval flow (`exec.approval.requested` and `exec.approval.resolve`) in gateway methods and protocol docs.
  - Session scoping supports `main`, `per-peer`, and `per-channel-peer` in routing/session key logic.
- Core tool names to reference in proposals are real OpenClaw tools, for example:
  - `exec`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `apply_patch`, `browser`, `cron`, `message`, `sessions_spawn`, `sessions_send`, `gateway`, `whatsapp_login`.

## ConsentGuard deployment options

- In-process middleware:
  - Pros: lower latency, simpler rollout, easier single choke point.
  - Cons: weaker process boundary if gateway process is fully compromised.
- Separate service:
  - Pros: stronger isolation and independent lifecycle.
  - Cons: more operational complexity and strict no-bypass enforcement required at every invoke path.
- Practical path:
  - Start in-process at invoke choke points.
  - Add optional out-of-process mode for higher assurance deployments.
